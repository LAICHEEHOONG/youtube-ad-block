**youtube-ad-block** is a Chrome extension that blocks ads on YouTube, including video ads and bottom-side square pop-up ads.

## How it Works

When you navigate to a YouTube video page, the extension will automatically detect and remove any video ads that play before or during the video, as well as the bottom-side square pop-up ads that appear during the video.
